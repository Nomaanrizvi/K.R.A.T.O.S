# K.R.A.T.O.S - A voice based chatbot

K.R.A.T.O.S stands for `Knowledgeable Responsive Assistant with Thoughtful Organized Speech`. This project is a voice-enabled chatbot that integrates OpenAI's API and speech recognition technology. It allows users to interact with the chatbot through voice input and receive intelligent responses in the form of speech.

## Features

- **Voice Input**: Users can speak to the chatbot, and the chatbot will recognize the speech using speech recognition technology.
- **Intelligent Speech Responses**: The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate intelligent, accurate responses and communicates them via text-to-speech for a fully voice-based interaction.
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: The chatbot can carry on conversations, handle follow-up questions, and engage in meaningful dialogue.
- **File Management**: The chatbot can utilize the os module to control the file explorer, allowing users to open, browse, and manage files through voice commands.
- **Web Navigation**: By using the webbrowser module, the chatbot allows users to open websites and perform web searches, all through voice commands for seamless browsing.

## Requirements

To run the chatbot, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `openai` library for accessing the OpenAI API
- `speech_recognition` library for converting speech to text
- `win32com.client` library for text-to-speech (voice output)
- `pyaudio` for microphone input support (only for mac users)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nomaanrizvi/K.R.A.T.O.S.git
   cd K.R.A.T.O.S
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the chatbot**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once everything is set up, the chatbot will listen for your voice input, convert it to text, generate a response using OpenAI's API, and then read the response aloud.

### Example Workflow:

1. **User speaks**: "Hello, how are you?"
2. **Chatbot processes**: The chatbot uses speech recognition to convert the audio to text and sends it to OpenAI's API for processing.
3. **Chatbot responds**: "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!"
4. **User hears the response**: The chatbot uses text-to-speech to say the response aloud.

You can continue the conversation naturally, and the chatbot will adapt to follow-up questions.

## Customization

- **Custom Responses**: You can modify the behavior of the chatbot by adjusting the `openai` API parameters or by adding specific prompt instructions for better customization.
- **Voice Settings**: Adjust the voice output (rate, volume, voice type) in the `win32com.client` settings to personalize the chatbotâ€™s voice.
